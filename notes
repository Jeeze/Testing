Mitigation reserve is the amt of money that we set aside to offset the risk

MR = MC + ResImpact

Risk Leverage, you want it to always be greater than one during the mitigation

RL = (Project impact/MC)

	Note: if it's less than or equal to one we only do the amt of mitigation 	necessary to keep the RL greater than 1.

		The calculation must be done for each risk identified in the
		project.

First! Calculate the cost of the project without profit (labor hours)
Next! add management reserve
Last! add profit margin (7%-10% of above)
